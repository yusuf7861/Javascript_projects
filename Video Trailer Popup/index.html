        <h1>Movie Title</h1>
        <p>A film - also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture or photoplay - is a work of visual art
            that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or
            atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sounds and more
            rarely, other sensory stimulations. The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to
            filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.
            <!-- Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures, facilitating intercultural dialogue. It is
            considered to be an important art form that provides entertainment and historical value, often visually
            documenting a period of time. The visual basis of the medium gives it a universal power of communication,
            often stretched further through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other
            languages. -->
